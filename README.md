# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

**Febin Wilson**  
Robotics Engineer specializing in hardware-software integration, reinforcement learning, and autonomous systems. Building robots that work in the real world—not just in simulation.

Fresh off completing my **Master's in Robotics at Northeastern University**, I'm currently researching bipedal locomotion and reinforcement learning algorithms at the **Silicon Synapse Lab**. My passion lies in making robots reliable, practical, and impactful through robust control systems and intelligent navigation.
